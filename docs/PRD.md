# Weather Forecast System - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

The Weather Forecast System (WFS) is a distributed microservices application built entirely using Java and the Spring ecosystem. It retrieves weather data from third-party providers, processes and stores this information, and makes it available to users through both a web interface and programmatic API. The system demonstrates robust distributed systems principles while providing an opportunity to develop expertise in Java and Spring technologies.

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Key Objectives

- Provide accurate, timely weather information for global locations
- Implement high availability and resilience during third-party API outages
- Support horizontal scalability for handling varying workloads
- Maintain low latency for data retrieval operations
- Demonstrate distributed systems patterns using Java and Spring technologies
- Serve as a portfolio project highlighting Java backend expertise

### 2.2 Target Users

- General public seeking weather forecasts through a web interface
- Developers integrating weather data into their applications
- Data analysts requiring historical and trend-based weather information
- Internal operations teams managing system health and performance

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Interface

- Clean, responsive dashboard displaying current weather and forecasts
- Location search
- Support for saving favorite locations
- Mobile-responsive design for all screen sizes

### 3.2 Weather Data

- Current weather conditions including:
  - Temperature (actual, feels like, min/max)
  - Humidity percentage
  - Wind speed
  - Atmospheric pressure
  - Visibility
  - UV index
  - Air quality index

- Forecast capabilities:
  - Hourly forecast for next 48 hours
  - Daily forecast for next 7 days
  - Historical data for previous 30 days
  - Sunrise/sunset times

### 3.3 Location Management

- Location search by name
- Support for multiple location formats and address systems
- Geocoding capabilities
- Ability to save favorite locations

### 3.4 APIs and Integration

- RESTful API for data retrieval with proper documentation
- Streaming API using WebSockets for real-time updates
- Data export in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
- Rate limiting and API key management

### 3.5 System Resilience

- Caching of frequently requested data
- Graceful degradation during external API failures
- Fallback mechanisms for critical functionality
- Automatic recovery from service disruptions
- Background synchronization for data updates

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 End Users

1. As a user, I want to search for weather in my current location so I can plan my day.
2. As a user, I want to view hourly forecasts so I can decide the best time for outdoor activities.
3. As a user, I want to save favorite locations so I can quickly check weather for places I care about.
4. As a user, I want to view historical weather data so I can observe patterns and trends.

### 4.2 Developers

1. As a developer, I want to integrate weather data into my application using a reliable API.
2. As a developer, I want clear documentation to efficiently implement API calls.
3. As a developer, I want flexible data formats so I can parse information easily.

### 5.3 Administrators

1. As an administrator, I want to monitor system health to ensure service reliability.
2. As an administrator, I want to update third-party API keys without service disruption.
3. As an administrator, I want to configure caching policies to optimize performance.

## 5. Release Plan
